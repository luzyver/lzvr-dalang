# Changelog Automation

Patterns and tools for automating changelog generation, release notes, and version management following industry standards.

## Running inside Dalang

- Follow the project's existing CHANGELOG format and commit convention; do not install release tooling (semantic-release, commitizen, git hooks) unasked.
- Do not commit, tag or push: in Dalang the person does that from the panel.
- Release notes for people outside the team: write them in the chat in their language as ready-to-copy text.
- Paths in this skill (`references/`) are relative to this skill's folder.

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up automated changelog generation
- Implementing Conventional Commits
- Creating release note workflows
- Standardizing commit message formats
- Generating GitHub/GitLab release notes
- Managing semantic versioning

## Core Concepts

### 1. Keep a Changelog Format

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Commit Message Examples

```bash
# Feature with scope
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support for Google login

# Bug fix with issue reference
fix(checkout): resolve race condition in payment processing

Closes #123

# Breaking change
feat(api)!: change user endpoint response format

BREAKING CHANGE: The user endpoint now returns `userId` instead of `id`.
Migration guide: Update all API consumers to use the new field name.

# Multiple paragraphs
fix(database): handle connection timeouts gracefully

Previously, connection timeouts would cause the entire request to fail
without retry. This change implements exponential backoff with up to
3 retries before failing.

The timeout threshold has been increased from 5s to 10s based on p99
latency analysis.

Fixes #456

## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Follow Conventional Commits** - Enables automation
- **Write clear messages** - Future you will thank you
- **Reference issues** - Link commits to tickets
- **Use scopes consistently** - Define team conventions
- **Automate releases** - Reduce manual errors

### Don'ts

- **Don't mix changes** - One logical change per commit
- **Don't skip validation** - Use commitlint
- **Don't manual edit** - Generated changelogs only
- **Don't forget breaking changes** - Mark with `!` or footer
- **Don't ignore CI** - Validate commits in pipeline
